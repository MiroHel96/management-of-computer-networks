# Point-to-Point Single-Area OSPFv2 Configuration

In this report I configure Single-Area OSPFv2 and I do the following.:

- Configure Router IDs
- Configure Networks for OSPF Routing
- Configure Passive Interfaces 
- Verify OSPF configuration


# Configure Router IDs

To configure router IDs you must use following commands in the configuration mode. 

"router ospf process-id" - this command starts OSPFv2 routing process in Cisco devices. 
Router ID is a 32-bit value represented as an IPv4 address. It can be assigned automatically by router.

Router which has OSPF enabled with ID does the following 
- Participate in the synchronization of OSPF databases
- Participate in the election of the designated router (DR) 

I configured process id of 10 for all of the routers in the example. After I had this done I configured the following IDs for each router:
- R1 1.1.1.1
- R2 2.2.2.2
- R3 3.3.3.3

router-id ridd - command assigns the router ID
