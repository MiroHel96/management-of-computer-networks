After I opened Cisco Packet Tracer, I created general router and two host computers. I connected them to eachother with straight throughcable and opened my router to configure it's initial settings. 

Configurations for the router were: 

Interface GigabitEthernet 0/1 - 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0

Interface GigabitEthernet 0/2 - 192.168.20.2 255.255.255.0
